I am a junior software developer for [Aderant](http://aderant.com) who started a bit less traditionally than many other developers. In a former life, I was a graduate student studying [auditory selective attention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_auditory_attention) under [Dr. David W. Smith](http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~smithlab/Smithlab/Smith_Lab_Overview.html), when I rediscovered my love for programming and decided to work my way out of the 60+ hour weeks in a subterranean lab the size of a utility closet (well, it *was* a utility closet). 

As such, I have widely varied interests, ranging from science and science education to web, enterprise, and mobile development, to fitness and bodybuilding, gaming, comic collecting, and learning foreign languages. My hobbies can really be distilled down to one thing: learning. 

Thank you for visiting, I hope that you will find something that ignites your interest in something new, that teaches you a new trick (or induces you to teach me something!), or otherwise inspires.
