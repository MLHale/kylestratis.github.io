This site is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) and built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [lanyon](http://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. My plan for this site is to serve as a hub to view my projects, social media profiles, and, most importantly, to share what I've learned from implementing various projects. My hope with this blog is that it will help others who have run into similar roadblocks to think about a way around (or through) them. I will be implementing more features as time goes on, and in a future post I will share how this site was set up and customized.
